### Another takeaway is introducing you to Blazor
Blazor lets you build interactive web UIs using C# instead of JavaScript. Blazor apps are composed of reusable web UI components implemented using C#, HTML, and CSS. Both client and server code is written in C#, allowing you to share code and libraries. For more information check https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor
